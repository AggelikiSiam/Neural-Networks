# Neural-Networks
Big Data Content Analytics Assigment on Neural Networks

Our mission was to train a Neural Network that will predict/detect human activity through the daily use of smartphones that collect information via embedded inertial sensors.

# Tools Required
Python 3.6 is used during development and following libraries are required to run the code provided in the notebook:

* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

# Dataset
The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set  used for model training, can be downloaded from the following [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones#)
